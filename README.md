Demonstrator use cases for a variety of cyber scenarios

## Setup

This repo uses NPM workspaces.

Please make your code compatible with NodeJS v16.14.0, so that we can easily
run it on CheriBSD if we have to.

You can install dependencies by running `npm install`.

Follow these instructions to setup your own [NIST Data API provider](https://github.com/nqminds/UniBOM/blob/main/packages/sbom-gap-cli/nist-data-api/README.md).
